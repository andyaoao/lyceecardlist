## Installation
Environment: python 2.7.10

'pip install xlwt'
Implementing save data to the excel file with xlwt library.
## Idea
1. All cards are catogorized with each of the followings, Character, Event, Item, Area.
2. Need to deal with pages, limited Cards were showed in one page. 
3. Need to deal with missing tags in Character catogory.
4. Perhaps you need to deal with encryption problem.
5. Store all the strings in beffer then write to the excel file.
6. Do some string modification in MS Excel.
7. Done.
## What to do next
1. on the 'PLACE' field of the Character catogory, it should be displayed as a dice, but it is displayed as a string.
2. Reduce the dynamic memory used when downloading data.
## Data Source
AXL
## Note
